# RaffleJS

Let's say we have 5 letters. Let these be a, b, c, d, e. We want to do 3 draws for these and I want to determine 2 winners in the 1st draw, 1 winner in the 2nd draw and 1 winner in the 3rd draw. It can be anything you want to draw. I have already processed all the error messages that came to my mind into the code. Have fun. May your devil be abundant.
